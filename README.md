Track Google Nest statistics to make scheduling decisions for energy efficiency and HVAC/Heater longevity

Over the years, several different individuals have tackled this issue or something similar (mostly through forked maintenance; https://github.com/jkoelker/python-nest, https://github.com/axlan/python-nest, https://github.com/ZachGoldberg/nest-graph, https://github.com/jeff89179/nest-graph, https://github.com/peterot/nest-graph). Many of the tools are well out of date, being mostly untouched for the last few years.

If anything, the goal of this project is to update the product so many have worked on before to use modern tools.
